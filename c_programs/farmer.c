Farmer problem statement answer:- 
---------------------------------

Total Land Area is: 80 acres  
                   ----------
Land Segments is:-
----------------------

- Segment 1 has: Tomatoes.
- Segment 2 has: Potatoes.
- Segment 3 has: Cabbage.
- Segment 4 has: Sunflower.
- Segment 5 has: Sugarcane.

 Sales Yield for Each Crop is:
---------------------------------

1. Tomatoes price:
  ------------------
   - 30% of the tomato land (0.30 × 16 acres) gives 10 tonnes per acre.
   - 70% of the tomato land (0.70 × 16 acres) gives 12 tonnes per acre.
   - Selling price: Rs. 7 per kg.

2. Potatoes price:
  -----------------
   - Yield: 10 tonnes per acre.
   - Selling price: Rs. 20 per kg.

3. Cabbage price:
  -----------------
   - Yield: 14 tonnes per acre.
   - Selling price: Rs. 24 per kg.

4. Sunflower price:
  -----------------
   - Yield: 0.7 tonnes per acre.
   - Selling price: Rs. 200 per kg.

5. Sugarcane price:
  ------------------
   - Yield: 45 tonnes per acre.
   - Selling price: Rs. 4,000 per tonne.

 Calculation of Overall Sales (Total Sales from 80 Acres) is:
 -------------------------------------------------------------

 Tomatoes sales:
 ----------------
- 30% of 16 acres: 16 × 0.30 = 4.8 acres → Yield = 4.8 acres × 10 tonnes = 48 tonnes.
- 70% of 16 acres: 16 × 0.70 = 11.2 acres → Yield = 11.2 acres × 12 tonnes = 134.4 tonnes.
- Total yield for tomatoes: 48 tonnes + 134.4 tonnes = 182.4 tonnes.
- Convert to kilograms: 182.4 tonnes × 1000 = 182,400 kg.
- Selling price for tomatoes: Rs. 7 per kg.
- Sales from tomatoes: 182,400 kg × Rs. 7 = Rs. 1,272,800.

 Potatoes sales:
 ----------------
- Yield per acre: 10 tonnes per acre.
- Total yield for potatoes: 16 acres × 10 tonnes = 160 tonnes.
- Convert to kilograms: 160 tonnes × 1000 = 160,000 kg.
- Selling price for potatoes: Rs. 20 per kg.
- Sales from potatoes: 160,000 kg × Rs. 20 = Rs. 3,200,000.

 Cabbage sales:
 ---------------
- Yield per acre: 14 tonnes per acre.
- Total yield for cabbage: 16 acres × 14 tonnes = 224 tonnes.
- Convert to kilograms: 224 tonnes × 1000 = 224,000 kg.
- Selling price for cabbage: Rs. 24 per kg.
- Sales from cabbage: 224,000 kg × Rs. 24 = Rs. 5,376,000.

 Sunflower sales:
 -----------------
- Yield per acre: 0.7 tonnes per acre.
- Total yield for sunflower: 16 acres × 0.7 tonnes = 11.2 tonnes.
- Convert to kilograms: 11.2 tonnes × 1000 = 11,200 kg.
- Selling price for sunflower: Rs. 200 per kg.
- Sales from sunflower: 11,200 kg × Rs. 200 = Rs. 2,240,000.

 Sugarcane sales:
 -----------------
- Yield per acre: 45 tonnes per acre.
- Total yield for sugarcane: 16 acres × 45 tonnes = 720 tonnes.
- Sales from sugarcane: 720 tonnes × Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 2,880,000.

Total Sales (Overall Sales) is:
-------------------------------

Total sales from all crops is:
-------------------------------
- Sales from tomatoes: Rs. 1,272,800
- Sales from potatoes: Rs. 3,200,000
- Sales from cabbage: Rs. 5,376,000
- Sales from sunflower: Rs. 2,240,000
- Sales from sugarcane: Rs. 2,880,000

Overall Sales is = Rs. 1,272,800 + Rs. 3,200,000 + Rs. 5,376,000 + Rs. 2,240,000 + Rs. 2,880,000 = Rs. 15,968,800



Sales Realization from Chemical-Free Farming at the End of 11 Months is:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mahesh is converting his land to chemical-free farming over 11 months:
- First 6 months is for: Conversion of vegetable land (Tomatoes, Potatoes, Cabbage) to chemical-free.
- Next 4 months is for: Conversion of sunflower land to chemical-free.
- Final 4 months is for: Conversion of sugarcane land to chemical-free.

By the end of 11 months, the following crops will be converted to chemical-free farming:
1. Tomatoes: Chemical-free after 6 months, so the yield from tomatoes is entirely chemical-free.
2. Potatoes: Chemical-free after 6 months, so the yield from potatoes is entirely chemical-free.
3. Cabbage: Chemical-free after 6 months, so the yield from cabbage is entirely chemical-free.
4. Sunflower: Chemical-free after 10 months, so the yield from sunflower is entirely chemical-free.
5. Sugarcane: Not yet converted to chemical-free (only 4 months of conversion), so the yield from sugarcane is not chemical-free at the end of 11 months.

Thus, the chemical-free sales realization comes from:
- Tomatoes: Rs. 1,272,800
- Potatoes: Rs. 3,200,000
- Cabbage: Rs. 5,376,000
- Sunflower: Rs. 2,240,000

Sales Realization from Chemical-Free Farming = Rs. 1,272,800 + Rs. 3,200,000 + Rs. 5,376,000 + Rs. 2,240,000 = Rs. 12,088,800

 Final Answers:
-----------------

a. Overall sales achieved by Mahesh from the 80 acres of land: Rs. 15,968,800  
b. Sales realization from chemical-free farming at the end of 11 months: Rs. 12,088,800
